# ðŸ“š Library Mini-Project â€” Java

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description ðŸ”¹

This mini-project is designed to help you practice and consolidate your understanding of **String Manipulation, Looping, Conditional Statements, Exception Handling, Classes, and Two-Dimensional Arrays in Java**.
Additionally, youâ€™ll implement **Recursive Methods** to solve a small but realistic problem.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Goals ðŸ”¹

- Apply Java fundamentals to solve a real-world scenario.
- Develop confidence in coding routines, methods, classes, and control structures.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully with Exception Handling.
- Implement a recursive algorithm in a non-trivial context.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Application Concept ðŸ”¹

Weâ€™re developing a simplified **Library System** which lets you:

- **Add books** to a library.
- **View all books in the library.**
- **Search for a book by its title.**
- **Borrow and return books** by a user.
- **Count total borrowed books by a particular user** (using recursion).

This lets you combine all the fundamentals youâ€™ve learned in a realistic setting.

## ðŸ”¹ Implemented Java Concepts ðŸ”¹

âœ… **String Manipulation**
âœ… **Variables and Data Types**
âœ… **Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)**
âœ… **Looping (for, while, do-while)**
âœ… **One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Arrays**
âœ… **Recursive Method**
âœ… **Classes and Objects**
âœ… **Error Handling (Try/Catch)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ File Structure ðŸ”¹

```txt
Library/
 â”” src/
   â”” Main.java
   â”” Book.java
   â”” User.java
   â”” Library.java
README.md
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Guidelines and Clue to Implement ðŸ”¹

âœ… The main entry point is **Main.java** â€” hereâ€™s where you will:

- Display a **text-menu** for the usersâ€™ choices.
- Handle the **input and output**.
- Call methods implemented in other classes.

âœ… The **Book** class encapsulates the properties of a book (id, title, author, price).

âœ… The **User** class encapsulates a user's properties (id and name).

âœ… The **Library** class contains:

- An array of books.
- An array for borrowing (a 2D array).
- Methods to add books, view books, search, borrow, return, and count borrowed books (with recursion).

---

## ðŸ”¹ What You Should Implement ðŸ”¹

âœ… Implement **String Manipulation** (using `String.trim()` and `String.equalsIgnoreCase()`).

âœ… Implement **Variables and Data Types** with `int, double, String`.

âœ… Implement **Conditional Statements** to manage menus, borrowing, and more.

âœ… Implement **Looping** to:

- Loop through books.
- Loop through borrowing info.

âœ… Implement **One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Arrays** (array of books and borrowing).

âœ… Implement **Recursive Method** to calculate total borrowed books for a user.

âœ… Implement **Classes with Encapsulation** (Book, User, Library).

âœ… Implement **Error Handling with Try/Catch** when invalid input is provided.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Additional Challenge (Optional) ðŸ”¹

âœ… Implement **sorting of books by title or price**.
âœ… Implement **return messages to aid usersâ€™ understanding**.
âœ… Handle invalid inputs gracefully instead of crashing.
âœ… Expand functionality (like adding authors, due dates, or penalties).

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run ðŸ”¹

1. Compile:

```bash
javac src/Main.java src/Book.java src/User.java src/Library.java
```

2. Run:

```bash
java src.Main
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ What to Submit ðŸ”¹

âœ… Your **full Java code** (with comments).
âœ… The **README.md** with your instructions and explanations.
âœ… Short **steps you implemented or problems you solved**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Grading Criteria ðŸ”¹

âœ… Proper application of **String Manipulation, Looping, Conditionals, Exception Handling, Classes, and 2D arrays**.
âœ… Implementing **Recursive Method** for total borrowed books.
âœ… Code is well-structured, clear, and easy to follow.
âœ… Exception Handling gracefully guides users instead of crashing.
âœ… Comments and explanations reflect understanding.
